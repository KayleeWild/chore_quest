# Overview

The goal of Chore Quest is to make helping around the house more fun and engaging by gamifying it with a mobile app.

Last Update: 11/02

The current app has a welcome screen with a demo button to add a child. Currently, the button only prints a message to the console, but will eventually lead to a form to fill out info about and display a list of views for each child added.
On the second page, there is a similar button, but instead of adding a child, this one will eventually add chores, with options to assign them to children. Right now, it also just prints a message to the console when pressed.

 *Expect many updates in the future, this app has a long way to go right now.

# Future Work

* Connect all the pages with navigation
* Add pages for forms and views for how to display the chore chart/children when added
* Connect forms to the "add" buttons
* Set up storage for user data, and allow for users to sign in from different devices
* Provide user authentication
* Re-work design and color palette to be more professional yet kid-friendly
* Design and program rewards to be added optionally to certain chores, such as allowance, screen time, etc.
* Implement settings tab to configure light/dark mode, choose which kind of reward to implement, delete account, set passcodes, and more.
* Deploy to app stores and determine how to make money off of the app (ads? subscription? one-time payment?)
